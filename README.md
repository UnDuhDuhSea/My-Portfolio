My current Portfolio.

## Description
This project is my current porfolio. This website is split into three sections
which overview my currrent experience with web development. Each of the boxes in the work 
section will take you to the different projects I have worked on. 

## Getting Started

The nav bar will take you to any location on the website. This website has been made with 
a responsive layout which should be styled and adapts to any viewport.
